# Principal-Component-Analysis-in-Data-Dimentionality-Reduction

This project includes the codes I wrote to reduce data dimentionality in PCA and then visualize PCA.

I first programmed PCA and visualized the projections to verify if PCA works well on the given dataset. Then I tried to employ PCA on face image compression and reconstructed the compressed face image back to original one. The result was promising. The reconstructed image looked pretty much the same as the original one. One last trick I wrote was to visualize PCA which converts a 3D data into 2D. It was super amazing to see how PCA managed to store this data accurately with only slight deviation.
